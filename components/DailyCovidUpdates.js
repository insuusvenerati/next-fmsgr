                Cases in Kent County are increasing rapidly. We must act now to reduce the spread of
                this virus. Here are some things that you can do to keep yourself safe and to help
                stop the spread of COVID-19:
              </p>
              <ul className="list-group pl-2">
                <li className="">
                  Wear a face mask any time you are outside your home (over your mouth AND nose!)
                </li>
                <li className="">
                  Physically distance yourself at least 6 feet from other persons outside your home
                </li>
                <li className="">
                  Wash your hands frequently with soap and water for 20 seconds or use alcohol-based
                  hand sanitizer
                </li>
                <li className="">
                  Try to avoid touching your face – especially your eyes, nose, and mouth
                </li>
                <li className="">
                  Disinfect “high touch” areas in your home and car regularly with a disinfectant
                  wipe or cleaning solution
                </li>
                <li className="">
                  Get plenty of rest, eat well, and generally take care of yourself!!
                </li>
                <li className="">
                  Avoid gatherings with people outside of your immediate household members,
                  especially indoors and especially with large groups. Wear a mask if you do need to
                  attend.

              <p>
                COVID-19 testing is widely available and anyone who wants a test can have a test.
                Unfortunately, with the rapid increase in cases, you may have to wait in line to be
                tested. Plan ahead. Time to get results varies, but is generally 24-72 hours.
              </p>

                <h4>Quarantine:</h4>
              </header>
              <p>
                Persons who have had direct (“first degree”) exposure to a person positive for
                COVID19 should quarantine for 14 days after the last known exposure.
              </p>
              <ul className="list-group pl-2">
                <li>
                  The incubation period for COVID19 is anywhere between 2 and 14 days. This means
                  symptoms could show up anywhere between 2 and 14 days from when you are exposed.
                </li>
                <li>
                  While we do highly recommend testing for exposed persons, you need to be careful
                  to not get tested too early and get a “false negative”.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>
                    Please wait at least 5 days after the exposure to get tested for COVID19.
                  </strong>
                </li>
                <li>
                  If you do start getting symptoms at any point during the quarantine period, get
                  testing immediately. There is no need to wait further.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Remember that even with a negative test, you are not “safe” and need to quarantine
                  until the 14 days has passed.
                </li>
